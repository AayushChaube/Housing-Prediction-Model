# Housing-Prediction-Model

Worked on a dataset which consists information about the location of the house, price and other aspects such as square feet etc. When I worked on these sorts of data, I needed to see which column is important for me and which is not. My main aim was to make a model which can give me a good prediction on the price of the house based on other variables. I used Linear Regression for this dataset and saw if it gives me a good accuracy or not. 
What is good accuracy? Well, it depends on what sort of data we are working with, for a credit risk data an accuracy of 80% may not be good enough but for a data using NLP it would be good. So we can't actually define "good accuracy" but anything  above 85% is good. My aim on this dataset was to achieve an accuracy score of 85%+

From the given dataset I answered/performed the following questions/actions (respectively):
  1. What can I infer from the dataset?
  2. Which is the most common house (Bedroom wise)?
  3. Visualizing the location of the houses based on latitude and longitude.
  4. How houses are placed?
  5. How common factors are affecting the price of the house?
  6. Price vs Square feet and Price vs Longitude
  7. What more factors are affecting the price?
  8. Total sqft including basement vs price and waterfront vs price 
  9. Floors vs Price and condition vs Price
  10. Which location by zip code is Pricey?
  11. Perform Linear Regression and train model
